    "### A good practice: use relative paths\n",
    "\n",
    "The above directives require explicitly writing the absolute pathnames, which are virtually always computer specific.\n",
    "If, for instance, Brian has a project organised in a folder (`s`) with a directory dedicated to input data (`Life`)\n",
    "and a notebook for preprocessing (`welease.ipynb`) as illustrate below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "C:\\users\n",
    "|    +-- Brian\n",
    "|    |    +-- s\n",
    "|    |    |   +-- Life\n",
    "|    |    |   |   +-- wodger.spg\n",
    "|    |    |   +-- welease.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then running this project in John's Linux computer (e.g. in `\\home\\john\\s_copy`) will certainly result in execution\n",
    "errors if absolute paths are used in the notebook:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "OSError: Can't find this filename C:\\users\\Brian\\s\\life\\wodger.spg\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this respect, a good practice consists in using relative pathnames in scripts and notebooks.\n",
    "Fortunately, SpectroChemPy readers use relative paths. If the given path is not absolute, then SpectroChemPy will\n",
    "search in the current directory. Hence, the opening of the `spg` file from scripts in `welease.ipynb` can be made\n",
    "by the command:\n",
    "```ipython3\n",
    "X = scp.read_omnic('Life/wodger.spg')\n",
    "```\n",
    "or:\n",
    "```ipython3\n",
    "X = scp.read_omnic('wodger.spg', directory='Life')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good practice: use `os` or `pathlib` modules\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, working with pathnames is classically done with dedicated modules such as `os` or `pathlib` python modules.\n",
    "With `os` we mention the following methods that can be particularly useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython3\n",
    "import os\n",
    "os.getcwd()              # returns the absolute path of the current working directory preferences.datadir\n",
    "os.path.expanduser(\"~\")  # returns the home directory of the user\n",
    "os.path.join('path1','path2','path3', ...)   # intelligently concatenates path components\n",
    "                                             # using the system separator (`/`or `\\\\`)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `Pathlib` is even simpler:\n",
    "```ipython3\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "Path.cwd()               # returns the absolute path of the current working directory\n",
