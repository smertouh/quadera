    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "MCR-ALS (standing for Multivariate Curve Resolution - Alternating Least Squares) is a popular method for resolving a\n",
    "set (or several sets) of spectra $X$ of an evolving mixture (or a set of mixtures) into the spectra $S^t$ of 'pure'\n",
    "species and their concentration profiles $C$. In terms of matrix equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ X = C S^t + E $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The ALS algorithm allows applying soft or hard constraints (e.g., non negativity, unimodality, equality to a given\n",
    "profile) to the spectra or concentration profiles of pure species. This property makes MCR-ALS an extremely flexible\n",
